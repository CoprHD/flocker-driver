Introduction
============
Contributions are developed using test-driven development, code reviews and per-issue branches. Each unit of work is defined in an issue in the issue tracker and developed on a branch. Code is written using test-driven development. The issue is closed by merging the branch (via a GitHub pull request). Before a branch is merged it must pass code review.

- The code reviewer ensures that the pull request:
- Follows the coding standard (Python's PEP 8).
- Includes appropriate documentation.
- Has full test coverage (unit tests and functional tests).
- Resolves the issue.
- Talk to Us
